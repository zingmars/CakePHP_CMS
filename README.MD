# CMS in CakePHP

School project for web development class.

To install - checkout in your /www dir; Checkout CakePHP 3.0 using composer (vendor directory) and then rename app.default.php to app.php and edit it to match your configuration. Use CakePHP's migration tool to restore the database schema.

I also wrote a simple Android app for this CMS available at <https://github.com/zingmars/CMS_Android_App>.
